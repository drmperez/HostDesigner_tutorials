This directory contains one subdirectory with the PCModel files used to 
create input fragment geometries and eight subdirectories containing input
files needed to perform HostDesigher LINKER runs to build bidente ligands.

The making_fragments subdirectory contains the following structures for each
type of donor group: aquo ion complex with one aquo O atom replaced by the
donor group, metal + donor group with all O atoms removed, and the input
fragment that was derived from the latter structure.

There are two LINKER run subdirectories for each combination of donor groups.
One uses all links and the other uses only synthetically accessible links.

To run one of these examples, enter the subdirectory and launch HostDesigner.
