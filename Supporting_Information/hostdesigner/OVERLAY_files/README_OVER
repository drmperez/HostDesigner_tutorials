This directory contains eight subdirectories, each containing input files
needed to perform HostDesigner OVERLAY runs to build bidentate ligands.

There are two subdirectories for each combination of donor groups.  One tries
all links and the other tries only synthetically accessible links.

To run one of these examples, enter the subdirectory and launch HostDesigner.
