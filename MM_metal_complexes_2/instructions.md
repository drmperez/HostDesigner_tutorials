## Metal-ligand complexes

Included are seven additional SDF mol files of structures from the CSD.   For six of them the ligands are illustrated in the accompanying pdf file.  The seventh one, APDPZC, and a tetra ammonium complex of Pd2+.

The assignment is to use these coordinates to make MM3 input files, optimize them, and perform superpositions and report the rmsd values.

As before, the MMFF94 model has parameters that allow you to run the two Cu2+ complexes using the electrostatic model.  Try it to see how well it works.
